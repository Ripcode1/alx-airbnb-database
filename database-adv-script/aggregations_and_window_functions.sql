-- Query 1: Find the total number of bookings made by each user using COUNT and GROUP BY
SELECT 
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings
FROM 
    User u
LEFT JOIN 
    Booking b ON u.user_id = b.user_id
GROUP BY 
    u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email
ORDER BY 
    total_bookings DESC, u.user_id;

-- Query 2: Use ROW_NUMBER to rank properties based on the total number of bookings
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS row_rank
FROM 
    Property p
LEFT JOIN 
    Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY 
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
ORDER BY 
    total_bookings DESC;

-- Query 3: Use RANK to rank properties based on the total number of bookings
-- RANK allows for ties (same rank for properties with equal bookings)
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS property_rank
FROM 
    Property p
LEFT JOIN 
    Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY 
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
ORDER BY 
    property_rank, p.property_id;

-- Additional Query: Use DENSE_RANK for continuous ranking without gaps
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM 
    Property p
LEFT JOIN 
    Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY 
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
ORDER BY 
    dense_rank, p.property_id;

-- Advanced Query: Partition by location and rank within each location
SELECT 
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.location,
    p.pricepernight,
    COUNT(b.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY p.location ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS location_rank,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(b.booking_id) DESC) AS overall_rank
FROM 
    Property p
LEFT JOIN 
    Booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY 
    p.property_id, p.name, p.location, p.pricepernight
ORDER BY 
    p.location, location_rank;
